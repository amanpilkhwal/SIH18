                    The word <strong>Drought</strong> has various meanings, depending on a person's perspective. To a farmer, a drought is a period of moisture deficiency that affects the crops under cultivation—even two weeks without rainfall can stress many crops during certain periods of the growing cycle. To a meteorologist, a drought is a prolonged period when precipitation is less than normal. To a water manager, a drought is a deficiency in water supply that affects water availability and water quality. To a hydrologist, a drought is an extended period of decreased precipitation and streamflow.

                    A drought is a period of drier-than-normal conditions that results in water-related problems. Precipitation (rain or snow) falls in uneven patterns across the country. When little or no rain falls, soils can dry out and plants can die. When rainfall is less than normal for several weeks, months, or years, the flow of streams and rivers declines, water levels in lakes and reservoirs fall, and the depth to water in wells increases. If dry weather persists and water-supply problems develop, the dry period can become a drought. Not only these but also the temperature, soil type, solar radiation, canopy cover and many other factors causes drought.

                    The beginning of a drought is difficult to determine. Several weeks, months, or even years may pass before people know that a drought is occurring. The end of a drought can occur as gradually as it began. Dry periods can last for 10 years or more. The first evidence of drought usually is seen in records of rainfall. Within a short period of time, the amount of moisture in soils can begin to decrease. The effects of a drought on flow in streams and reservoirs may not be noticed for several weeks or months. Water levels in wells may not reflect a shortage of rainfall for a year or more after a drought begins.

                    A period of below-normal rainfall does not necessarily result in drought conditions. Some rain returns to the air as water vapour when water evaporates from water surfaces and from moist soil. Sunlight, humidity, temperature, and wind affect the rate of evapotranspiration. When evapotranspiration rates are large, soils can lose moisture and dry conditions can develop. During cool, cloudy weather, evapotranspiration rates may be small enough to offset periods of below-normal precipitation and a drought may be less severe or may not develop at all.

                    A single rainstorm in any form will not break the drought, but it may provide temporary relief. A moderate shower will probably only provide cosmetic relief. It might make folks and wildlife feel better for awhile, provide cooling, and make the vegetation perk up. Its impact is short term. The benefits of substantial rainfall such as from a tropical storm may last for months, but a return to normal rainfall patterns and amounts is necessary for conditions in streams, reservoirs, and ground water to also return to normal. A single soaking rain will provide lasting relief from drought conditions, but multiple such rains over several months may be required to break a drought and return conditions to within the normal range.

                    Groundwater is one of the Nation's most important natural resources. The water level in the aquifer that supplies a well does not always stay the same. Droughts, seasonal variations in rainfall, and pumping affect the height of the underground water levels. If a well is pumped at a faster rate than the aquifer around it is recharged by precipitation or other underground flow, then water levels in the well can be lowered. This can happen during drought, due to the extreme deficit of rain. The water level in a well can also be lowered if other wells near it are withdrawing too much water.

                   Prolonged drought conditions can have impacts on wildlife which range from relatively minor - such as decreased fat reserves - to impacts resulting in a significant loss of wildlife. Drought conditions can affect wildlife populations in many ways, from changing homeland ranges in an effort to find water to creating conditions that can impact health. High temperatures and low rainfall can contribute to outbreaks of Clostridium botulinum or avian botulism, which is a bacterium that typically resides dormant in the soil. Under the right conditions, these bacteria can replicate and produce toxins. Hence the multiutility vehicles, wireless and GPS sets could be used for patrolling the entire areas for protection of animals.

                   Landscape planning for conservation of biodiversity aims at developing and ultimately implementing management for such lands in a consistent, integrated manner. The Landscape Area Plan is one of the principle implications of the National Forest Policy of 1988 for achieving goals for biological diversity. Trained wildlife experts with adequate rescue and rehabilitation centers and the goodwill of people towards wildlife would certainly improve the situation in the ground level and protect the wildlife which has strayed out of their habitats.

                    Drought affects our lives in many different ways because water is such an important part of so many activities. We need water to live, and animals and plants do too. We need water to grow the food we eat. Water is also used to help generate the electricity we use to run the lights in our houses. When we don’t have enough water for these activities because of a drought, many people and many different things will be affected in many different ways.

                    Human activities that can trigger the drought includes: Widespread cutting down of trees for fuel reduces the soil's ability to hold water. This means, cutting down trees (deforestation) in the name of economics, will expose surface water to more evaporation. It will also reduce the ability of the ground to hold water and make it easier for desertification to occur. It can set off drying conditions, especially for smaller water bodies. Cutting down trees is known to reduce a forest’s watershed potential.
